## *A Treasure Trove of Pointless Python Peculiarities*

This repository contains a bunch of random, useless Python scripts that I write. Most will use libraries included in a standard installation of Python 3.10/3.11, but additional libraries will be listed as comments within scripts to tell you what libraries you need to install from pip.

All of these scripts are free to use with no credit necessary. I make these out of boredom.
